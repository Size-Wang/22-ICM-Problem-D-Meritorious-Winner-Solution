## üß© Introduction

In the era of big data, data is a strategic asset for companies seeking a competitive edge. Effective management, analysis, and security of data are crucial for establishing such an advantage. Our team (#2209617) was commissioned by ICM Corporation to develop reliable metrics and evaluate the maturity of its Data and Analysis (DA) System using the information provided.

We present a comprehensive solution that includes scientifically validated models, actionable guidance for system development, and an analysis of the model's generalization ability across different scales and industries. Our approach combines statistical algorithms, expert assessment, and machine learning techniques to deliver robust recommendations for ICM Corporation and similar organizations.

## üí° Solution Overview

Our solution addresses four main tasks outlined in the problem statement:

### **Task 1: Building an Evaluation System**
- Developed a multi-layer evaluation index system based on executive considerations.
- Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA), expert scoring, and logistic regression for indirect indicators.
- Applied Entropy Weight Method (EWM) to compute indicator weights.
- Calculated key indices: People Index, Technology Index, and Process Index.
- Synthesized expert scores using the Group Decision Method (GDM) and discriminant matrix to derive the Maturity Index.
- Benchmarked system maturity using metrics generated from simulated data with K-means Clustering.

### **Task 2: Model Application & Guidance**
- Detailed how the model guides DA system evolution.
- Provided operational methods and case studies.
- Offered targeted recommendations for systems lacking in talent or technology.

### **Task 3: Protocol for Maturity Measurement**
- Proposed a protocol for ICM Corporation to measure company maturity, using simulated data.
- Applied the developed methods to similar companies to generate actionable guidance.
- Built a maturity-effectiveness relationship model via exponential fitting with clipping.

### **Task 4: Model Generalization**
- Investigated model adaptability through sensitivity analysis.
- Demonstrated reliability across different seaports and industries.
